# FunctionArguments

A list that documents a function's signature.

## Guidelines

- There is no unique syntax for creating a UsageGuideline component in MDX files. Therefore, use the component as you would in a regular JSX file.

## Props

| Prop       | Description                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `children` | `<li>`s that represent the function's arguments. |
