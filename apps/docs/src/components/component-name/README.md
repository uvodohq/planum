# Component name

The main title of a component docs MDX page.

## Guidelines

- In MDX documents, you can create a title using this syntax: `#Main header name` (will create a title with the value "Main header name").
- Component name should appear only once at the top of the component MDX file.
- The component name will always be identical to the of the component as it appears in the left menu.
- If the component name contains multiple words, use a capital letter only for the first letter of the first word
